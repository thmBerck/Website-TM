# Website-TM
This is the GitHub repository for the T&amp;M Entertainment website that I have made for **the Backend-Web course.**

As mentioned in the assignment, the "about" page contains all the cited sources.

I am developing the Laravel website for my business, which focuses on providing online video editing services to clients. The primary objective of this website is to enhance efficiency and improve communication with our clients.

Previously, my business partner and I communicated with our clients using Discord, but we found it to be less professional. This led us to the idea of creating a dedicated website. Since I need to create a website for my Backend-Web course, I decided to merge these two objectives and work on the website for my business as part of my coursework.
